# SuperAI
SuperAI is a python based Artificial Intelligence Program. You can speak to it a plethora of tasks, and it will do it for you.

# Requirements
The superAI.exe file (https://github.com/MrAyushBajpai/SuperAI/releases/tag/v1.0) does not have any requirement. 

However to build from the sources, you will need the following Modules. You can install these using pip:-
1. wikipedia (https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/)
2. pyttsx3 (https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
4. speechRecognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)  

You will need to place the files(SpecialitesFinder.py, module.py and config.cfg) in the folder same as main.py.  
main.py is the file that has to be executed, while the rest are just its complemantry files.
